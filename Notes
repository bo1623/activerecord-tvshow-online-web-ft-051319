Rake
- I wanted to make a change of the data type for the "season" attribute from integer to string
- But even after saving it and running rake db:migrate, the table still remained the same, with season's data type still integer
- So i had to rollback the table to its previous version using db:rollback
- After that I ran db:migrate again and it worked
